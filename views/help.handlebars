      <p>
        Use <strong>Filter &amp; Search</strong> to narrow arrests by borough,
        precinct, offense, demographics, and date. This is the best place for
        focused analysis.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Combine borough + offense + age group filters.</li>
        <li>Compare patterns across different boroughs.</li>
        <li>Use filtered results to guide what you look at in the dashboard.</li>
      </ul>

    <article class="help-card">
      <h2>3. Looking for Trends</h2>
      <p>
        Visit the <strong>Statistical Dashboard</strong> and the
        <strong>Monthly / Weekly Trends</strong> pages to see the bigger picture
        over time.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Check total arrests and the most common offense.</li>

      <h2>4. Doing Research or a Class Project</h2>
      <p>
        Use this app as a <strong>learning dataset</strong> based on real NYC Open
        Data, sampled to keep things fast for coursework and experimentation.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Great for homework, slides, and quick experiments.</li>
        <li>Patterns are realistic, but totals won’t match official NYPD counts.</li>

  <!-- How to use this site (short, structured) -->
  <section class="help-section">
    <h2>How This Site Is Organized</h2>
    <div class="help-two-column">
      <div>
        <h3>Home</h3>
        <p>
          High-level introduction and core feature cards
          (Browse Arrests, Filter &amp; Search, Crime Ranking, Trends).
        </p>

        <h3>Browse Arrests</h3>
        <p>
          Paginated table of individual arrest records with details like
          date, borough, offense description, law category, age group, gender,
          race, and approximate location.
        </p>

        <h3>Filter &amp; Search</h3>
        <p>
          Advanced filters to narrow down arrests by borough, precinct,
          offense, law category (felony / misdemeanor / violation),
          age group, gender, and race. Use this when you want a very
          specific slice of the data.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Crime Ranking</h3>
        <p>
          Aggregates the data to show which offenses appear most frequently
          across NYC. Helpful for quickly spotting the top recurring charges.
        </p>

        <h3>Statistical Dashboard</h3>
        <p>
          Shows a summary view:
          total arrests, most common offense, top borough,
          approximate average age, and live charts for arrests by borough
          and monthly trends <strong>computed from the current dataset</strong>
          (not hard-coded numbers).
        </p>

        <h3>Monthly &amp; Weekly Trends</h3>
        <p>
          Visualizes total arrests over time using real arrest dates.
          Monthly trends show the broader pattern; weekly trends highlight
          shorter-term spikes and dips.

  <!-- FAQ section -->
  <section class="help-section">
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Where does the data come from?</h3>
      <p>
        All records are pulled from the official
        <strong>NYC Open Data API</strong> for NYPD arrests. Our backend fetches
        the data in pages, cleans it, and stores a curated subset in our own
        MongoDB database for faster queries and visualizations.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What time period does the data cover?</h3>
      <p>
        The dataset reflects the latest available months of the current year
        from NYC Open Data. In our current setup, the records typically span
        from <strong>January through September</strong>, depending on what the
        API has published when we seed the database.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Why do you use stratified sampling instead of every single record?</h3>
      <p>
        The full NYC arrest dataset is very large. For this project,
        we fetch tens of thousands of rows from the API and then perform
        <strong>stratified sampling by borough</strong> (around 400 records per
        borough). This keeps the app responsive while still preserving
        realistic borough-level and temporal patterns.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How often can the data be updated?</h3>
      <p>
        The data can be refreshed any time by re-running the seeding script.
        Each run pulls the latest NYC Open Data records, re-samples them, and
        recalculates the monthly and weekly trends that power the charts.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Why do some charts show “(Dataset)” vs “(Sample)”? </h3>
      <p>
        When everything loads correctly from the database, the charts display
        labels like <strong>(Dataset)</strong> to indicate they are based on
        real aggregated values. If something goes wrong (for example, the DB is
        empty or an API call fails), the app falls back to a small built-in
        sample so the page still renders, labeled as <strong>(Sample)</strong>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Do I need an account to use this?</h3>
      <p>
        No account is required for basic exploration, filtering, and viewing
        charts. If we later add features like saved views or favorites,
        those may require login, but the core visualizations remain open.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What if something looks wrong or confusing?</h3>
      <p>
        Because this is a course project, we intentionally include safety
        checks and defaults. If a number or chart looks strange, it might be
        due to sampling, API limits, or how NYC reports certain categories.
        You can always re-seed the database or cross-check against the
        original NYC Open Data portal.
