        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Where does the data come from?</h3>
            <p>
                The arrest records are sourced from the NYC Open Data portal. 
                We load a cleaned subset of this dataset into our database for analysis and visualization purpose.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What time period does the data cover?</h3>
            <p>
                The exact date range depends on the subset we imported, but it generally spans recent years of NYPD arrest records. 
                We update our database weekly, so that it includes the latest available data for visualization.
